Artificial   Intelli-
gence    is   transforming   industries  world
wide. From healthcare  to finance, its ability   
to analyze vast   amounts  of data makes decision
making faster and  more accurate. However, challenges 
such as bias   and transparency still 
need   to be addressed.  

Machine   Learn-
ing,   a subset of A I, allows  systems to 
learn   from  experience without being 
explicitly  programmed. By training on large data-
sets,   these models can recognize  patterns,  
predict outcomes,   and improve over time  
with minimal human intervention.    

Natural   Language Processing enables  
machines   to   under-
stand and interact  using human  
language. Applications   include  
chatbots,  translation    services, and sentiment   
analysis. With   advancements in deep learning,  
N L P systems are becoming more accurate   
and  context-aware each   day.
