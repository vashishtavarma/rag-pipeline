Git is a distributed version control system that revolutionized software development by allowing developers to track changes, collaborate efficiently, and maintain complete project histories. Unlike centralized systems, Git stores the entire repository history locally, enabling offline work and faster operations. Key concepts include commits, branches, merges, and the staging area, which provides fine-grained control over what changes are included in each commit.

GitHub transformed Git from a command-line tool into a social platform for code collaboration. It provides web-based hosting for Git repositories, along with features like pull requests, issues tracking, project boards, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The platform has become the de facto standard for open-source projects and enterprise development, fostering a global community of developers who contribute to millions of repositories.

Confluence is Atlassian's enterprise wiki and collaboration platform designed to help teams create, organize, and share knowledge. It serves as a central hub for documentation, project planning, meeting notes, and team collaboration. With its rich text editor, templates, and integration capabilities, Confluence enables teams to maintain living documentation that evolves with their projects and processes.

Jira, also by Atlassian, is a powerful project management and issue tracking tool widely used in agile development environments. It supports various methodologies including Scrum and Kanban, providing features for sprint planning, backlog management, bug tracking, and reporting. Jira's customizable workflows and extensive integration ecosystem make it adaptable to diverse team needs and development processes.

Docker revolutionized application deployment through containerization technology. By packaging applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers, Docker ensures consistent behavior across different environments. This approach solves the "it works on my machine" problem and enables microservices architectures, simplified deployment pipelines, and efficient resource utilization.

Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Originally developed by Google, Kubernetes provides features like service discovery, load balancing, automated rollouts and rollbacks, and self-healing capabilities, making it the standard for managing containerized workloads at scale.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's most comprehensive cloud computing platform, offering over 200 services including compute power, storage, databases, networking, analytics, and machine learning. AWS enables organizations to build scalable, reliable, and cost-effective solutions without maintaining physical infrastructure. Services like EC2, S3, RDS, and Lambda have become fundamental building blocks for modern cloud-native applications.
